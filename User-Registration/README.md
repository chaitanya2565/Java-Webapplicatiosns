# User-Registration
You are required to create a Servlet+JDBC program to facilitate the login process for creation of users of a website. If the user supplies the correct username and password as created in assignment-8, she is allowed entry to the websiteâ€™s resources, else not.

There should be a lostPassword button on the login page as well. If the password is lost, the user is asked to provide their email ID, and date of birth. Then the user is sent the secret question they had stored; the answer to the question must be returned by the user. If it matches the stored answer, the user is returned their password as stored in the MySql table. Then show that the login happens as expected.
