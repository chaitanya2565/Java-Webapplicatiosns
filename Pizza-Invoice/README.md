The two files Registration.java and Registration.xhtml have been uploaded on Moodle.

Use NetBeans to create the project jsfDemo in the folder C:\JSF, and copy these files into the project.

Read every line of code, then execute Registration.xhtml. Test every feature listed, and make sure that you understand the programs in every respect.

Now create a Pizza-ordering program on similar lines.
