# JSP-Registration-Form
You are required to create a Servlet+JDBC program to facilitate the creation of users of a website. The MySql table allUsers should contain the following fields:

fname, lname, emailId, password, date-of-birth, place-of-birth, username, secretQuestion, secretAnswer.

The HTML form should provide text boxes to read this information. It should also have a submit button, which when clicked should send the information as a record into the table allUsers.

The username should be unique. If a duplicated user-name is provided by the applicant, she must be asked to try another username.

The password must be at least 8 characters long, and must contain digits, upper and lowercase letters, and at least one non-alphabetic and non-digit character.

Your program must ensure that all these conditions are met.
