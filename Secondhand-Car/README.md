# Second-Car
You are required to create a JDBC program to facilitate the purchase of second-hand motorcars. The database called UsedCars contains a table called allCars with the following fields:
carMake [for example Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, etc.]
carModel [for example Dzire, Zen, Wagon R, etc. - invent your own names if needed.]
carYear [of manufacture]
carPrice [of sale to customer]
A) Write a Java method, called from main (), to return a Connection object to main (). Be sure to include all the imports, as well as the handling of any exceptions.                                                                           
B) In the main () method write down the command to create the table allCars.                                     
C) In the main () method write down the command to insert a record into the table.                         
D) Show how to read in (using a keyboard Scanner) each of the above fields/variables.                    
E) Show all the steps required to create a PreparedStatement to insert the above fields into a record of the table.                                                                                                                                                                                
F) Show how to display on the console the field carYear for all the records in the table.                    
G) Show how to find the total sale-value of all the cars in the store's inventory.
