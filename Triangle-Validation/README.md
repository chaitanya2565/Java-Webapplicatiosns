# Triangle-Validation
Create a facelet-Java bean pair of files to reproduce the following screen in every particular. Initially the inputText boxes contain the value 0.0 for each side. Then the numbers 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 are entered, and the five buttons are clicked one by one. The following screen is then created.
One problem with this program is that it does not check if any two sides are greater than the third side. How can you solve it?
Another problem with this program is that a user may enter invalid i.e. non-numeric values into the text-boxes. How can this be prevented. [The solution will be provided in the week following exam-week, by the use of validators.]
